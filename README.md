# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Ensemble Learning

## Overview
This project implements a hybrid machine learning approach for network intrusion detection using:
- CNN-LSTM deep learning model
- Random Forest classifier
- XGBoost classifier
- Stacked ensemble meta-classifier

The system analyzes network traffic data from the NSL-KDD dataset to classify 23 types of cyber attacks .

## Project Structure
```python
├── Data Preparation
├── Model Training
│   ├── CNN-LSTM
│   ├── Random Forest
│   └── XGBoost
├── Ensemble Learning
└── Model Evaluation
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ids-ensemble.git
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Requires: PyTorch, XGBoost, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn*

## Usage
### Step 1: Prepare Data
- Place NSL-KDD dataset files in `/content/drive/MyDrive/IDS/`
  - `NSL_KDD_Train.csv`
  - `NSL_KDD_Test.csv`

### Step 2: Run Training Pipeline
```python
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Key Functionality
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Automatic handling of missing values
   - Categorical feature encoding
   - Feature alignment between datasets 
   - Label encoding for attack classes

2. **Model Training**
   - CNN-LSTM architecture for temporal pattern detection
   - Tree-based models for feature importance analysis
   - Ensemble meta-classifier combining predictions

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Confusion matrix visualization
   - ROC curve analysis 
   - Cross-validation scores

## Performance
| Model           | Accuracy |
|-----------------|----------|
| CNN-LSTM        | 69.27%   |
| Random Forest   | 72.23%   |
| XGBoost         | 72.27%   |
| Stacked Ensemble| 72.27%   |

## Model Persistence
Trained models are saved to:
```
/content/drive/MyDrive/IDS_Models/
├── cnn_lstm_model.pth
├── random_forest_model.pkl
├── xgboost_model.pkl
└── stacked_meta_classifier.pkl
```
